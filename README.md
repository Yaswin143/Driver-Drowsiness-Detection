# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting driver drowsiness using deep learning techniques. Driver drowsiness is a significant factor in many road accidents, and early detection can prevent potential accidents. We employ computer vision and deep learning models to monitor the driver's eyes and facial expressions in real-time, determining whether they are drowsy or alert.

## Features
- detection of drowsiness using webcam feed.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for eye state classification.
- Alerts the driver when drowsiness is detected through visual and auditory cues.
- It helps to prevent accident.
